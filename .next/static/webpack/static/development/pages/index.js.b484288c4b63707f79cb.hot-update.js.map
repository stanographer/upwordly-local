You login, create a job, connect your CAT software via a small helper app, and start\n              writing. Distribute your live feed to anyone via a short URL and that's it! Since it is web based, there's\n              no need for your consumers to install anything on their end. When the job is over, it's your choice to use\n              the variety of tools to save or disseminate the transcript or to delete it.
